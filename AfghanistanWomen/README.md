# The Eduation of Afghanistan Women

### About
<p>This visualization is meant to convey the stories of women and girls in Afghanistan who havve been denied access to education. The narratives incuded in this data set have historicaly been undervalued and silenced. This work elevates those silences voices and brings to the fore the story of educational access along gender lines.</p>

### The Interactions 
<p>The intent of the interactions is to allow the user to navigate the themes that apepar throughout the narratives. The interactivity allows the used to explore the data in a more personalized fashion. If left in static form, the data would not highlight themes and trends as easily.</p>

### The Data 
The data is actively being mined from a vareity of nonprofit origanizations that have surveyed and collected data from females in Afghanistan. The data sets include narrative and first name.  The analysis that will be used for the interactivity is as a result of a coding project that I conducted and added to the dataset. 

### The Visualization Methodology 
I opted to keep narrative, a visualizatoni of text, as the visualization.
